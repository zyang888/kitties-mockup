      <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and
      purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintlly with a claw then lick paws clean
      wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest
      spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to
      leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the
      floor; what's your problem? I meant to do that now I shall wash myself
      intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
      <p>Fall over dead (not really but get sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog
      likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yam mouse, bare fangs at toy run
      hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always
      hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>

              <h2>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h2>
              <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and
                purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintlly with a claw then lick paws clean
                wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest
                spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to
                leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the
                floor; what's your problem? I meant to do that now I shall wash myself
                intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
                <p>Fall over dead (not really but get sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog
                  likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yam mouse, bare fangs at toy run
                  hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always
                  hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
